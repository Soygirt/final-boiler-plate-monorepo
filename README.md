# Final project Technigo Bootcamp 

Welcome to Olga Lepist√∂ and Elin Olaussons final project for the Technigo bootcamp!

The idea for this app came to us after we searched for rescue dogs and realized that all organisations had their own website, and some even just used a facebook group to display the dogs that needs new homes. 

The intention with Rescue Helper is to make a platform where different organisations can display the dogs they've got for adoption- all in one place!

Organisations can get a log in and add/delete dogs anytime they want. We wanted to make the app user friendly and easy to use, so the people at the rescue organisations could spend their time helping even more dogs find good forever homes.


# Tech
For this project we've used the following tech:

## Figma
## React
## React Router
## Node.js/Express
## Mongoose/MongoDB
## Vite
## Zustand
## ChatGPT

# Planning
We started with making a design sketch for the app in Figma since we both are of the oppinion that it's easier to start with a basic sketch to see what components, pages and buttons we need.
After that we discussed what features the app should have, and devided the tasks between us. 

We made different branches in GitHub and worked on them spearately, but helped eachother out when we got stuck. 
We used ChatGPT to create the "About us"-page, a .json file that contained 45 dogs and their attributes (such as name, estimated age, if it's a special adoption or not).



# Problems

We encountered a bunch of problems during this project. 
The first, and biggest problem was with connecting to the Mongo database. We spent several hours trying to figure out what was wrong, including googling, searching for answers on youtube and asking ChatGPT. We then booked a meeting with one of our teachers at Technigo and realized that there was just one line of code missing! 

We've been struggling a bit with the whole backend part! We had just spent 4 weeks learning about the backend when we started this project, and we quickly realized that this was going to be the most difficult part of the project for us.
We found log in and authorization to be the trickiest parts. Nevertheless we had a lot of fun discovering the backend. 
But we also had some hard days where we wanted to tear our hair of, but the aha moments we reached (almost) every day kept our spirits up!

Another thing that had an impact on our project was lack of time. The final project stretched over christmas and new years, which was a bit tricky for us. Even though there was a two weeks christmas break, it was in the middle of the project and that made it a bit tricky to remember things from before the break when it was time to start again after new years.
We are both working our old jobs besides the studys, which of course also have had an impact on the time we've been able to spend on the project. 

But even though we've had som struggles during the project we've had lots of fun and many laughs together! 

# Future implementations
If we had more time there's so much we want to do with this app!

The first thing would be to fix a way for users/organisations to upload images of the dogs! We tried implementing this using Google cloud as storage for image URLs, and then linking the URLs to the .json file in the code. But when we created the add/delete feature in the app there was no longer need for this -json file. And there simply wasn't enough time for us to solve the issue before the deadline.

Another thing we thought about was to make it possible for people who wants to adopt a dog to also be able to create an account and send messages to the organisations. That could make it easier for adopters and organisations to communicate. We also want to implement a "favourite" button, so the adopter can save and have easy acces to the dogs they're particularly interested in.
